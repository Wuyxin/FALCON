# FALCON: Efficient Automatic Machine Learning via Design Graphs

This is the source code for Falcon --- an efficient AutoML approach on design graphs --- based on [graphgym](https://github.com/snap-stanford/GraphGym) and [nni](https://github.com/microsoft/nni).


Quick location of Falcon implementations: `graphgym.automl.algorithms.Falcon` and `nni.retiarii.strategy.FalconTrainer`.
